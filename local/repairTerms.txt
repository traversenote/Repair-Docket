We have an expectation of a minimum of two weeks for repair turnaround. If the cost of the repair is over $200, a quote will be provided. This quote is an estimate based on the investigations done by the service technician. If the decision is made not to repair an item or an item is deemed uneconomical to repair, a Minimum Service Charge of $80 applies. Freight and packaging will be billed in addition to any repair costs.
